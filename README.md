# Problem of the Day Solutions

Welcome to my repository where I solve daily programming problems from various platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and more. Each day, I'll tackle a new problem, explain my approach, and provide a working solution.

## Repository Structure

- Each problem is stored in its own folder, named after the problem.
- Every folder includes:
  - A **README.md** with:
    - Approach explanation
    - Time and space complexity analysis
  - A **solution file** containing the code solution in a relevant programming language (e.g., Python, Java, etc.).

## How to Navigate

1. Navigate to the specific folder for the problem you are interested in.
2. Read through the **README.md** for the approach and complexity analysis.
3. View the **solution file** to check the implementation.

## Platform

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute by submitting issues or suggesting optimizations for the solutions. You can also fork the repository and add your own solutions for different problems.
